# ENLACE-DiSCoVER
Project made in the Research program at UCSD: ENLACE. It was worked with the GenePattern server and its notebooks with the public module / algorithm DiSCoVER (Disease-model Signature vs Compound-Variety Enriched Response). The point was to look for robustnes on the program depending on the cancer and control samples used from the patients.
